Use the following endpoints for twilio:
http://_your app_/text.php <== SMS endpoint
http://_your app_/fail.php <== Fallback endpoint

Warning:

* uses the dorky PhpObjectGenerator framework, primarily because I was racing myself and wanted it to be fast;
* requires a twilio account; point your url to _your app_/text.php
* is perfect.
